## Research Interests
I am currently investigating the application of **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** to identify complex, non-linear patterns in transactional data for financial fraud detection. Additionally, I am exploring **Federated Learning (FL)** frameworks to enable privacy-preserving machine learning in decentralized enterprise environments.

Previously, I have led global digital transformations at the enterprise level, focusing on hardening organizational infrastructure against automated threats while maintaining rigorous governance standards.
