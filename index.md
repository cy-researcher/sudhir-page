    <p>I am a <strong>Scholar-Practitioner</strong> and PhD researcher at <strong>Sri Sri University</strong>. My work bridges 25 years of global enterprise leadership with doctoral-level research in <strong>AI Governance</strong> and <strong>Cyber Resilience</strong>.</p>
      <p>Currently, my research focuses on navigating the transition from traditional architecture to Generative AI systems. I am particularly interested in <strong>Federated Learning</strong> for privacy-preserving machine learning and leveraging <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNN)</strong> for advanced financial fraud detection.</p>

## Research Interests
I am currently investigating the application of **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** to identify complex, non-linear patterns in transactional data for financial fraud detection. Additionally, I am exploring **Federated Learning (FL)** frameworks to enable privacy-preserving machine learning in decentralized enterprise environments.

Previously, I have led global digital transformations at the enterprise level, focusing on hardening organizational infrastructure against automated threats while maintaining rigorous governance standards.
