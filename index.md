# Sudhir Mardikar

I am a scholar-practitioner and PhD researcher at Sri Sri University. My work bridges 25 years of global enterprise leadership with doctoral-level research in **AI Governance** and **Cyber Resilience**.

Currently, my research focuses on navigating the transition from traditional architecture to Generative AI systems. I am particularly interested in **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving machine learning and leveraging **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for advanced financial fraud detection.

Previously, I have led global digital transformations at the enterprise level, focusing on hardening organizational infrastructure against automated threats while maintaining rigorous governance standards.
